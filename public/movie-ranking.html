<h1>The Best Movies According to Tosin</h1>
<p>I recently started watching movies from the early 2000s. They have that timeless, thrilling quality.
    Things were still raw and real before new age movies could takeover. None of it was for an award, just raw, real content.</p>
<p>They have a way of capturing the intensity and vulnerability of love that can make you feel all the emotions all over again. Plus, there is something about the way the stories
    were told back then that feels more authentic and heartfelt. They just don't make them like that anymore.!
</p>
<p>Below are my top three early 2000 movie selections:</p>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<ol>
<li><h3>Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind</h3></li>
<p>This was such a good watch. "How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine
    of the spotless mind!". This was such an emotional and beautiful line from the movie.</p>
<p>This movie is a masterpiece of emotion and story-telling. A beautiful blend of raw emotion and fun that dives into the complexities of relationships and the pain of loss.
<p>I rate this movie a 10/10, if you love indie images and the old style of film.</p>    
<li><h3>The Notebook</h3></li>
<p>This is hands down my favorite love story. 
    It dawned on me that everyone should experience this type of romance like the ones in this movie. Love letters, reading poetry on a blanket on the beach, great heat and passion, slow dancing and being looked deeply into your lovers eyes while singing a song to each other with an emphasis on the lyrics, taking baths together and feeling each otherâ€™s energy.<br>
    <p>If you love romance, like i do, then the ending is going to leave you crying and wailing.<br></p>
    I rate this movie a 10.</p>
<li><h3>Before Sunrise</h3></li>
<p>Super beautiful film. Where do i even start? The instant connection between Jesse and celine, their inimate face to face conversations, It felt
    so real. It was like i was eavesdropping on their conversations becasue of how passionate it was.
We don't get that in the real world anymore. Everyone is scared of a good commitment and not wanting anyone
to know who they truly are. It's a movie that actually makes you think about life, love and what could have been.</p>
<p>I rate it a 10 also.</p>
